Giant snapping turtles are aggressive predators that lie in wait in shallow waters. Their lumpy shells provide excellent camouflage, and their disproportionately long necks can snap at enemies up to 10 ft away. Both turtle types can retract vulnerable parts into their shells for protection but cannot attack or move when doing so."
